    "\n",
    "### What is a probabilistic programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A probabilistic programming language (PPL) is a programming language designed to describe probabilistic models and then perform inference in those models. PPLs are closely related to graphical models and Bayesian networks but are more expressive and flexible. Probabilistic programming represents an attempt to \"Unify general purpose programming\" with probabilistic modeling.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "-Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "A PPL is a domain-specific programming language for that lets you write a data generating story as a program. As with a causal Bayesian network, you can write your program in a way that orders the steps of its execution according to cause and effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How exactly do Bayesian networks and probabilistic programming differ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representation of relationships between variables**.  BNs restricted to representing the relationships between variables in terms of conditional probability distributions (CPDs) factored according to a DAG.  Frameworks typically limit you to a small set of parametric CPDs (e.g., Gaussian, multinomial).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as computer programs are more expressive than flow charts, PPLs let you represent relations any way you like so long as you can represent them in code.  PPL relationships can include control flow and recursion.  In causal models, we will see that this allows you to be more specific about mechanism than you can with CPDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DAG vs. open world models**.  BNs restrict the representation of the joint distribution to a DAG.  This constraint enables you to reason easily about the joint distribution through graph-theoretic operations like d-separation.  PPLs need not be constrained to a DAG.  For example (using an imaginary Python PPL package):\n",
    "\n",
    "    X = Bernoulli(p)\n",
    "    if X == 1:\n",
    "        Y = Gaussian(0, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a DAG, you have a fixed set of variables, i.e. a \"closed world\".  In the above model, the variable Y is only instantiated if X==1.  Y may or may not exist depending on how the generative process unfolds.  For a more extreme example, consider this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    X = Poisson(λ)\n",
    "    Y = [Gaussian(0, 1)]\n",
    "    for i in range(1, X):\n",
    "        Y[i] = Gaussian(Y[i-1], 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you have the total number of Y variables itself being a random variable X.  Further, the mean of the ith Y is a random variable given by the i-1th Y.  You can't do that with a Bayes net!  Unfortunately, we can't reason about this as directly as we can with a DAG.  For example, recall that with the DAG, we had a convenient algorithm called `CPDAG` that converts the DAG to a partially directed acyclic graph structure called a PDAG that provides a compact representation of all the DAGs in an equivalence class.  How might we define an equivalence class on this program?  Certainly, enumerating all programs with an equivalent representation of the joint distribution would be very difficult even with constraints on the length of the program.  In general, enumerating all programs of minimal description that provide equivalent representations of a joint distribution is an NP-hard problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference**  When you have a DAG and a constrained set of parametric CPDs, as well as constraints on the kind of inference,  queries the user can make, you can implement some inference algorithms in your BN framework that will generally work in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "PPLs are more flexible than BNs, but the trade-off s that getting inference to work is harder.   PPL's develop several abstractions for inference and leave it to the user to apply them, requiring the user to become something of an expert in inference algorithms.  PPL developers make design decisions to make inference easier for the user, though this often sacrifices some flexibility.  One emergent pattern is to build PPLs on tensor-based frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch.  Tensor-based PPLs allow a data scientist with experience building deep learning models to rely on that experience when doing inference.\n",
