Recall the survey DAG discussed in the previous homework. Use **survey.txt** and the DAG structure to answer Question 1 and Question 2.

* **Age (A):** It is recorded as *young* (**young**) for individuals below 30 years, *adult* (**adult**) for individuals between 30 and 60 years old, and *old* (**old**) for people older than 60.
* **Sex (S):** The biological sex of individual, recorded as *male* (**M**) or *female* (**F**).
* **Education (E):** The highest level of education or training completed by the individual, recorded either *high school* (**high**) or *university degree* (**uni**).
* **Occupation (O):** It is recorded as an *employee* (**emp**) or a *self employed* (**self**) worker.
* **Residence (R):** The size of the city the individual lives in, recorded as *small* (**small**) or *big* (**big**).
* **Travel (T):** The means of transport favoured by the individual, recorded as *car* (**car**), *train* (**train**) or *other* (**other**)

We use the following directed acyclic graph (DAG) as our basis for building a model of the process that generated this data.

!["survey.png"](survey.png)

Build the DAG and name it `net`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(bnlearn)
.data <- read.delim('survey.txt', sep = " ")
net <- model2network("[A][S][E|A:S][O|E][R|E][T|O:R]")
```

First, run the following code block to create the `d_sep` function .

```{r}
# This is the same as the bnlearn's `dsep` function but 
# avoids some type checking which would throw errors in this homework.
d_sep <- bnlearn:::dseparation
```

The following code evaluates the d-separation statement "A is d-separated from E by R and T".  This statement is false.

```{r}
d_sep(bn = net, x = 'A', y = 'E', z = c('R', 'T'))
```

We are going to do a brute-force evaluation of every possible d-separation statement for this graph.

```{r}
vars <- nodes(net)
pairs <- combn(x = vars, 2, list)
arg_sets <- list()
for(pair in pairs){
  others <- setdiff(vars, pair)
  conditioning_sets <- unlist(lapply(0:4, function(.x) combn(others, .x, list)), recursive = F)
  for(set in conditioning_sets){
    args <- list(x = pair[1], y = pair[2], z = set)
    arg_sets <- c(arg_sets, list(args)) 
  }
}
```

For each pair of variables in the DAG, we want to evaluated if they are d-separated by the other nodes in the DAG.  The code above does a bit of combinatorics to grab all pairs of variables from that DAG, and then for each pair, calculates all subsets of size 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 of other variables that are not in that pair. List `arg_sets` contains all the pairs with all the combinations of other variables for each pair.


## Question 1: Markov Property (12 points)

A joint distribution ${P_{\mathbb{X}}}$ is said to satisfy **Markov property** with respect to DAG ${G}$ if for all disjoint node sets A, B, C satisfy $A \perp_{G}B|C \Rightarrow  A \perp_{P}B|C$. In other words, every true d-separation statement in DAG G corresponds to a true conditional independence statement in joint probability distribution P. In this question, we will evaluate if Markov property holds for our survey DAG and dataset **survey.txt**. We don't have the true underlying joint probability distribution that generated this data, but we can do statistical tests for conditional independence on the data we have.

### 1.1
Create a new list. Iterate through the list of argument sets and evaluate if the d-separation statement is true. If a statement is true, add it to the list. Show code. What is the number of true d-separation statements? (1 point)

### 1.2 
Consider a pair of nodes $(X, Y)$, assuming they are not connected by a direct edge. For a set $Z$ that makes $X$ and $Y$ d-separate (i.e. $X \perp Y | Z$ ), if removing any element from Z would break the d-separation between $X$ and $Y$ (i.e.  X and Y becomes dependent), then we consider  $X \perp Y | Z$ a nonredundant d-separation statment. Write two d-separation statements, one redundant and the other nonredundant, for a pair of nodes (A, T). (2 points)

### 1.3 
List all the nonredundant d-separation statements for each pair of nodes that are not connnected by a directed edge. (3 points)

### 1.4
Based on this understanding of redundancy, how can you make this algorithm for finding true d-separation statements more efficient? (2 points)

### 1.5 
The `ci.test` function in `bnlearn` does statistical tests for conditional independence. Using 0.05 as threshold, when $p < 0.05$, null hypothesis of conditional independence is rejected, and we conclude the pair (x,y) are dependent. When $p \geq 0.05$, null hypothesis can't we rejected, and we conclude the pair (x, y) are independent. Evaluate the global Markov property assumption by doing conditional independence test on each true d-separation statement. What is the proportion of true d-separation statements that are also true conditional independence statements? (2 points)
 
### 1.6
If we only consider nonredundant true d-separation statements, what is the proportion of them that are true conditional independence statements? (1 point)

### 1.7
Based on the results, how well does Markov property assumption hold up with this DAG and dataset? (1 point)

## Question 2: Faithfulness (6 points)

A joint distribution $P$ is **faithful** to DAG ${\mathbb{G}}$ if all disjoint node sets A, B, C satisfy $A \perp_{P}B|C \Rightarrow  A \perp_{G}B|C$. In other words, every true conditional independence statement about the joint distribution corresponds to a true d-separation statement in the DAG. In this question, we will evaluate if faithfulness  holds for our survey DAG and dataset **survey.txt**.

### 2.1 
Iterate through the `arg_sets` list, run `ci.test` for each argument set in the list, creating a new list of sets where you conclude the conditional independence statement is true. What is the number of true conditional independence statements? (2 point)

### 2.2
Evaluate faithfulness assumption by doing d-separation test on each true conditional independence statement. What is the proportion of true conditional independence statements that are also true d-separation statements? (2 point)

### 2.3 
If we only consider non-redundant d-separation statements, what is the proportion of true conditional independence statements that are also true nonredundant d-separation statements? (1 point)

### 2.4 
Based on the results, how well does faithfulness assumption hold up with this DAG and dataset? (1 point)

## Question 3: Intervention as graph mutilation (12 points)

Run the following code to build a simple three node graph.

```{r, canonical, fig.width=2, fig.height=2, fig.align="center"}
net <- model2network('[A][B|A][C|B:A]')
alias <- c('off', 'on')
cptA <- matrix(c(0.5, 0.5), ncol=2)
dimnames(cptA) <- list(NULL, alias)
cptB <- matrix(c(.8, .2, .1, .9), ncol=2)
dimnames(cptB) <- list(B = alias, A = alias)
cptC <- matrix(c(.9, .1, .99, .01, .1, .9, .4, .6))
dim(cptC) <- c(2, 2, 2)
dimnames(cptC) <-  list(C = alias, A = alias, B = alias)
model <- custom.fit(net, list(A = cptA, B = cptB, C = cptC))
graphviz.plot(model)
```


### 3.1 
Given this model, use Bayes rule to calculate by hand $P(A = on | B = on, C = on)$. Show process (3 points)

### 3.2
Estimate this probability using *rejection sampling*. To do this, use the `rbn` function in `bnlearn` (use `?rbn` to learn about it) to create a dataframe with a large number of sampled values from the model. Remove the rows where B and C are not both 'on'.  Estimate the $P(A = on | B = on, C = on)$ as the proportion of rows where A == 'on'.  (Pro tip: Try the `filter` function in the package `dplyr`).  (3 points)

### 3.3 
Use `mutilated` to create a new graph under the intervention $\text{do}(B = on)$.  Plot the new graph. (1 point)

### 3.4 
Calculate by hand $P(A = on | \text{do}(B = on), C = on)$. Show process (3 points)

### 3.5 
Estimate $P(A = on | \text{do}(B = on), C = on)$ using rejection sampling. (2 points)

## Question 4: Implement intervention in Pyro (9 points)

### 4.1
Implement the model in Question 3 in `pyro`. (3 points)

### 4.2
Compute $P(A = on | B = on, C = on)$ using `pyro.condition` and an inference algorthm. (3 points)

### 4.3
Compute $P(A = on | \text{do}(B = on), C = on)$  using `pyro.do` and an inference algorthm. (3 points)
